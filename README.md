Hi, my name is Adrián Bolonio. I currently work as an Accessibility Software Engineer working on making the Internet a better and more accessible place for everyone.

When I’m not at the office I enjoy a good read, working my way through any delicious recipe, and indulging my love for travelling to new places.

I write post about frontend and web accessibility in [my blog](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/blog), and as well I regularly give talks at conferences about accessibility. You can find [my speaker experience in my website](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/talks).

You can find me in [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adrianbolonio), in [my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/bolonio), or you can [send me an email](mailto:adrian.bolonio@gmail.com).
